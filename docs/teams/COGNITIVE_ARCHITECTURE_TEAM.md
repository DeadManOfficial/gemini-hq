# COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE TEAM - META-AGENTICS ENGINEERING
**Classification:** SOVEREIGN // RECURSIVE // RESEARCH
**Established:** 2025-12-25
**Authority:** The General (Direct Command)
**Status:** ACTIVE - ACT/LEARN/REUSE LOOP

---

## MISSION STATEMENT

> "We do not ship features. We refine the loop that ships itself."

The Cognitive Architecture Team designs the **Act-Learn-Reuse** engine that powers self-improving expert agents. This is not standard software engineering; it is continuous cognitive optimization. The team builds the system that **writes, evaluates, and refines** its own prompt templates and tool usage patterns.

---

## THE INFINITE LOOP

1. **ACT:** Specialized agents execute tasks with tools and structured outputs.
2. **OBSERVE:** Results are scored by evaluators and logged as traces.
3. **LEARN:** Failures trigger prompt rewrites and policy adjustments.
4. **REUSE:** Winning patterns and lessons are retrieved for the next run.

## TEAM ROSTER

| Codename | Role | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| **ARCHON** | Meta-Architect (Lead) | DSPy optimization, prompt compiler, pass-rate metrics |
| **ATLAS** | Knowledge Graph Engineer | Ontology design, GraphRAG, memory schemas |
| **ANVIL** | Toolsmith | OpenAPI/function design, structured tool I/O, safety gates |
| **GAUNTLET** | Adversarial Evaluator | Evaluation harnesses, robustness testing, failure analysis |

---

## CORE STACK

- **Orchestration:** LangGraph (cyclic state machines, long-running loops)
- **Optimization:** DSPy (prompt compilation and metric-driven tuning)
- **Memory:** GraphRAG + vector store (concept graphs + episodic traces)
- **Evaluation:** DeepEval or Ragas (automated grading and regression)
- **Telemetry:** OpenTelemetry + trace storage (audit + replay)

---

## OPERATING PRINCIPLES

- **Prompt-first, data-first:** prompts are compiled artifacts, not hand-edited text.
- **No generic agents:** expert personas are built from learned patterns and graphs.
- **Safety by design:** adversarial testing is scoped to controlled evaluation harnesses.
- **The game never ends:** every run feeds the next run's improvement.

---

## DELIVERABLES

- Prompt factory templates (dynamic context injection)
- Evaluation harnesses with measurable success criteria
- Knowledge graph schema and memory policies
- Tool interface registry with strict schemas
