## 5. Operational Workflow

### Daily Production Cycle

```
MORNING (Intelligence Phase):
1. RADAR scrapes APIs → Identifies 3 breakout topics
2. SKELETON receives #1 topic → Generates retention template

MIDDAY (Creative Phase):
3. AVATAR loads viewer persona → Provides slang/fears/memes
4. BAIT generates thumbnails → Selects winner (CTR gate)
5. Writer (human/AI) fills SKELETON template with AVATAR voice
6. PULSE engineers audio track

EVENING (QA Phase):
7. ROAST stress-tests full script → Edits or kills
8. If passed: STUDIO PRIME uploads to YouTube

NEXT DAY (Global Phase):
9. ECHO dubs to 3 languages → Uploads to separate channels
```

## 6. Key Rules

### The Packaging Rule
> "If you cannot generate a click-worthy thumbnail, the script is FORBIDDEN from being written."
>
> Thumbnail/Title comes FIRST. Content follows.

### The Avatar Rule
> "Every script begins with: 'You are writing for [Avatar Name]. They hate [Topic A] and love [Topic B]. Use their slang.'"

### The Dopamine Rule
> "Micro-interruption every 4-7 seconds. No exceptions. Viewers' attention is a perishable resource."

### The Global Rule
> "Every English video becomes 4 total videos. You film once, AI multiplies your reach."
